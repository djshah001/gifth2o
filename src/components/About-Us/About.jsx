        At Gifth2O, we are the modern youth of India, fueled by a passion to
        make a difference. Our mission is simple yet impactful: to ensure every
        community stays hydrated, breaking the notion that water should be
        bought. We believe in the power of generosity and the strength of unity,
        and we're here to revolutionize the way we think about water.
